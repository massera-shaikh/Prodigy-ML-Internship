## ✅ Task 3 – Decision Tree Classification

### 📌 Objective
Build a Decision Tree Classification model using the Iris dataset to:
- Load and analyze the dataset  
- Split into training/testing  
- Train DecisionTreeClassifier  
- Predict on test data  
- Evaluate performance  
- Visualize the decision tree
